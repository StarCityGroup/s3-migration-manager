# Bucket Brigade

Terminal UI for browsing S3 buckets, defining object masks, and managing storage tier transitions or restores without leaving the shell.

## Features

- **Bucket & object browser**: list all accessible buckets and their objects, including size and current storage class.
- **Lazy loading**: intelligently loads objects in batches of 200 for fast performance with large buckets (10k+ objects).
- **Auto-loading**: bucket selection triggers object loading after 1 second, then automatically switches focus to the Objects pane for intuitive navigation.
- **Accurate restore status**: automatically fetches actual restore state from S3 for Glacier objects (ListObjects doesn't include this data).
- **Request tracking**: view all restore requests with live status updates - persisted across sessions in `~/.config/bucket-brigade/restore_requests.json`.
- **Mask-driven selection**: build prefix/suffix/contains/regex masks, test matches live, and reuse them when defining migration policies.
- **Smart pagination**: automatically loads more objects when scrolling near the end or when masks need more matches.
- **Storage class transitions**: interactively choose a target tier; confirmations include an option to request restores before the copy operation.
- **Restore workflow**: request temporary Glacier restores (default 7 days) for the current selection.
- **Policy library**: persist mask + target-class rules to `~/.config/bucket-brigade/policies.json` for later reuse or auditing.
- **Deep storage visibility**: refresh metadata for any object to fetch its latest restore status before acting.
- **Structured object list**: fixed-width columns with restore status indicators (Restored, Restoring, NeedsRestore).

## Requirements

- Rust 1.78+ (toolchain with `cargo`).
- AWS credentials/profile accessible via the standard SDK lookup chain (env vars, `~/.aws/credentials`, SSO, etc.).

## Getting Started

```bash
cargo run
```

The first launch will download crates, create a config directory if needed, and enter the TUI.

## How It Works - Workflow Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Browse Buckets**: The app loads all accessible S3 buckets on startup
2. **Select Bucket**: Use arrow keys to select a bucket - objects auto-load after 1 second, then focus automatically switches to the Objects pane
3. **Filter with Masks**: Create patterns to filter objects (e.g., "logs-2024-*")
4. **Take Actions**: Transition storage classes, request restores, or save policies
5. **Track Progress**: Press `t` to view all restore requests and their current status
6. **Reuse Policies**: Apply saved masks+transitions without recreating them

**Performance Note**: For large buckets (millions of objects), the app loads objects in batches of 200. It shows "X objects (more available)" and automatically fetches more as you scroll or when masks need additional matches. No hanging or delays!

### Navigation

- **`Tab` / `Shift+Tab`**: Switch between panes (Buckets → Objects → Policies)
- **Arrow keys**: Move selection up/down (objects auto-load when you select a bucket)
- **`[` / `]`**: Cycle through regions
- **`PgUp` / `PgDn`**: Jump 5 items at a time
- **`Home` / `End`**: Jump to first/last item
- **`Enter`**: Apply selected policy (in Policies pane)

### UI Layout

The interface is organized for efficient workflow:

```

- **Top**: Compact bucket selector with region filter
- **Middle-Left**: Filter mask status, objects list, and selected object details
- **Right**: Saved policies for quick reuse
- **Bottom**: Status log and command hints

**Object List Format**:
- Fixed-width columns for consistent alignment
- Sizes always shown in KB (e.g., "1,234.56 KB")
- Restore indicators: `[✓]` available, `[⟳]` in progress, `[✗]` expired

### Object Filtering with Masks

Masks let you select multiple objects matching a pattern:

1. **Create a mask**: Press `m` to open the mask editor
2. **Configure the filter**:
   - **Name**: Type to replace "Untitled mask" (placeholder auto-clears on first keystroke)
   - **Pattern**: The text to match (e.g., "logs-2024-")
   - **Mode**: Use `←/→` or `Space` to cycle through: Prefix, Suffix, Contains, or Regex
   - **Case**: Use `←/→` or `Space` to toggle case-sensitive matching on/off
3. **Navigate fields**: Press `Tab` to move forward, `Shift+Tab` to move backward
4. **Apply**: Press `Enter` to apply the mask, `Esc` to cancel
5. **Clear active mask**: Press `Esc` (while browsing) to remove the filter

**Mask Editor Tips**:
- Type normally in Name and Pattern fields - all characters work (no special hotkeys)
- Use arrow keys or space to change Mode and Case settings
- The Name field placeholder clears automatically when you start typing

**Important**: When a mask is active, all operations (transitions, restores) apply to **all matching objects**, not just the selected one.

### Storage Operations

#### Transitioning Storage Classes

1. Select object(s) - either:
   - Single object: Just highlight it in the Objects pane
   - Multiple objects: Apply a mask first
2. Press `s` to start storage class selection
3. Choose target class (Standard, Standard-IA, Glacier, etc.)
4. Confirm the operation
5. **Optional**: Press `o` during confirmation to request restore before transition (for archived objects)

#### Requesting Restores

For objects in Glacier/Deep Archive storage:

1. Select object(s) (single or via mask)
2. Press `r` to request a 7-day restore
3. Confirm the operation
4. Press `t` to view tracked restore requests with live status

#### Tracking Restore Requests

The app automatically tracks all restore requests you make:

- **View all requests**: Press `t` to open the tracked requests panel
- **Status indicators**:
  - 🟡 **In Progress**: Restore request is being processed by AWS
  - 🟢 **Available**: Object has been restored and is accessible
  - 🔴 **Expired**: Restore window has passed
- **Persistence**: Requests are saved to `~/.config/bucket-brigade/restore_requests.json` and persist across sessions
- **Automatic updates**: Status is refreshed when you view tracked requests or navigate to objects

This solves the problem of "Did I already request a restore for this?" and lets you monitor restore progress across your entire account.

### Working with Policies

Policies save your mask + target storage class for reuse:

#### Saving a Policy

1. Create and apply a mask (`m`)
2. Select the bucket you want to use
3. Press `p` to save as policy
4. Choose the target storage class
5. Confirm - policy is saved to `~/.config/bucket-brigade/policies.json`

#### Using Saved Policies

Navigate to the Policies pane (press `Tab` until focused), then:

- **Apply as-is**:
  1. Select policy with arrow keys
  2. Press `Enter` to apply the mask and start transition
  3. Confirm the operation

- **Edit before using**:
  1. Select policy with arrow keys
  2. Press `e` to load the mask into the editor
  3. Modify the pattern/settings as needed
  4. Press `Enter` to apply the modified mask

**Note**: Policies remember the bucket name - make sure you have the correct bucket selected before applying.

### Other Commands

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `i` | Inspect selected object (refresh metadata via HeadObject) |
| `f` | Refresh the bucket list |
| `l` | Toggle status log (view full error messages and history) |
| `t` | Toggle tracked restore requests panel (view all pending/completed restores) |
| `?` | Toggle help screen |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit application |
| `Esc` | Clear active mask, or close dialogs/popups |

## Storage Policies

Saved policies live at `~/.config/bucket-brigade/policies.json`. Each entry records:

- Bucket name
- Mask definition
- Desired destination storage class
- Whether a restore should run before transition
- Timestamp and optional notes

You can version-control this file or edit it manually if needed.

## Testing & Validation

- `cargo check` (run during development) ensures the project builds and dependencies resolve.
- Most behavior depends on live AWS APIs; prefer running against a test account or buckets with dummy data before touching production buckets.

## Performance

The app is optimized for large S3 buckets:

- **Instant loading**: No upfront counting - starts loading objects immediately for responsive UI
- **Lazy loading**: Loads objects in batches of 200, showing "X objects (more available)" status
- **Smart prefetching**: Automatically loads more when:
  - Scrolling near the end of the list
  - Active mask has fewer than 100 matches and more objects are available
- **Efficient restore status**: Only fetches restore status for Glacier/Deep Archive objects (via concurrent HeadObject calls)
- **Memory efficient**: Only keeps loaded objects in memory, not the entire bucket
- **Non-blocking**: Background loading doesn't freeze the UI

Tested with buckets containing 1,000,000+ objects - no hanging or delays.

## Next Steps

Ideas for follow-up iterations:

1. Tag-based and size/date filters alongside the current key-based masks.
2. Background task queue so long copy/restore operations don't block the UI.
3. Mask-aware byte size estimations before executing transitions.
4. Optional cost estimation per plan using cached pricing tables.
5. CloudTrail-friendly dry-run mode that just logs intended actions.
6. Bulk operations with progress tracking and retry logic.
